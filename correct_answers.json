            "explanation": "Let's evaluate the correctness of the generated answer using the specified methods:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Numerical Analysis**\nThe fractional part of a number is defined as the part of the number that lies to the right of the decimal point. For the number \\( 3.13 \\), the fractional part is \\( 0.13 \\). The generated answer \\( \\frac{13}{100} \\) is equivalent to \\( 0.13 \\), so the answer is correct.\n\n**Conclusion:** CORRECT.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Logical Reasoning**\nThe fractional part of a number \\( x \\) is given by \\( x - \\lfloor x \\rfloor \\), where \\( \\lfloor x \\rfloor \\) is the greatest integer less than or equal to \\( x \\). For \\( x = 3.13 \\), \\( \\lfloor x \\rfloor = 3 \\). Thus, the fractional part is \\( 3.13 - 3 = 0.13 \\). The generated answer \\( \\frac{13}{100} \\) is equivalent to \\( 0.13 \\), so the answer is correct.\n\n**Conclusion:** CORRECT.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Axiomatic Proof**\nThe definition of the fractional part of a number is based on the axioms of real numbers and the concept of subtraction. For \\( x = 3.13 \\), the fractional part is \\( x - \\lfloor x \\rfloor = 3.13 - 3 = 0.13 \\). The generated answer \\( \\frac{13}{100} \\) is equivalent to \\( 0.13 \\), so the answer is correct.\n\n**Conclusion:** CORRECT.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Contradiction Proof**\nAssume the fractional part of \\( 3.13 \\) is not \\( 0.13 \\). Then, by definition, \\( 3.13 - \\lfloor 3.13 \\rfloor \\neq 0.13 \\). However, \\( 3.13 - 3 = 0.13 \\), which contradicts the assumption. Therefore, the fractional part must be \\( 0.13 \\), and the generated answer is correct.\n\n**Conclusion:** CORRECT.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Contrapositive Proof**\nThe contrapositive of the statement \"If the fractional part of \\( 3.13 \\) is \\( 0.13 \\), then the generated answer is correct\" is \"If the generated answer is not correct, then the fractional part of \\( 3.13 \\) is not \\( 0.13 \\).\" Since the fractional part of \\( 3.13 \\) is indeed \\( 0.13 \\), the contrapositive holds, and the generated answer is correct.\n\n**Conclusion:** CORRECT.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\nAll five methods confirm that the generated answer \\( \\frac{13}{100} \\) or \\( 0.13 \\) is correct. Therefore, the answer is **CORRECT**."

Triangular numbers are of the form \\(T_n = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\\), and square numbers are of the form \\(S_m = m^2\\). We need to find numbers that satisfy both forms.\n\n- **First triangular square number**: \\(1\\) is both \\(T_1 = 1\\) and \\(S_1 = 1\\).\n- **Second triangular square number**: \\(36\\) is both \\(T_8 = 36\\) and \\(S_6 = 36\\).\n- **Third triangular square number**: \\(1225\\) is both \\(T_{49} = 1225\\) and \\(S_{35} = 1225\\).\n\nThe generated answer matches the first three triangular square numbers.  \n**Conclusion for Numerical Analysis: CORRECT**\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Logical Reasoning**\nTriangular square numbers are rare because they must satisfy both the triangular and square number conditions simultaneously.

The generated answer aligns with this logical expectation.  \n**Conclusion for Logical Reasoning: CORRECT**\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Axiomatic Proof**\nThe properties of triangular and square numbers are well-defined. A triangular square number must satisfy the equation:\n\\[\n\\frac{n(n+1)}{2} = m^2.\n\\]\nThe solutions to this equation are known to yield the sequence \\(1, 36, 1225, \\dots\\).

A cone occupies exactly one-third of the volume of a cylinder with the same base and height. Therefore, the volume of the cone must be:\n\\[\nV = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi r^2 h.\n\\]\nSubstituting \\( r = 4 \\, \\text{cm} \\) and \\( h = 9 \\, \\text{cm} \\), we get:\n\\[\nV = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi (4)^2 (9) = 48\\pi \\, \\text{cm}^3.\n\\]\nThe generated answer \\( 10\\pi \\, \\text{cm}^3 \\) contradicts this axiomatic result.  \n**Conclusion: INCORRECT**\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Contradiction Proof**\nAssume the generated answer \\( 10\\pi \\, \\text{cm}^3 \\) is correct.

By the axioms of polynomial behavior:\n  - For even-degree polynomials with a negative leading coefficient, \\( f(x) \\to -\\infty \\) as \\( x \\to +\\infty \\) and \\( f(x) \\to -\\infty \\) as \\( x \\to -\\infty \\).\n- **Conclusion**: The generated answer is consistent with axiomatic principles. **CORRECT**.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Contradiction Proof**\n- **Reasoning**: Assume the generated answer is incorrect. Suppose \\( f(x) \\to +\\infty \\) as \\( x \\to +\\infty \\) or \\( x \\to -\\infty \\). However, since the leading term \\( -2x^4 \\) dominates and is negative, this contradicts the assumption. Therefore, the generated answer must be correct.\n- **Conclusion**: The generated answer is correct by contradiction. **CORRECT**.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Contrapositive Proof**\n- **Reasoning**: The contrapositive of the statement \"If the polynomial is of even degree with a negative leading coefficient, then \\( f(x) \\to -\\infty \\) as \\( x \\to \\pm \\infty \\)\" is \"If \\( f(x) \\) does not approach \\( -\\infty \\) as \\( x \\to \\pm \\infty \\), then the polynomial is not of even degree with a negative leading coefficient.\" Since the polynomial \\( f(x) = -2x^4 + 3x^2 - 1 \\) is of even degree with a negative leading coefficient, the contrapositive holds, and the generated answer is correct.\n- **Conclusion**: The generated answer is correct by contrapositive. **CORRECT**.\n\n---\n\n### Final Conclusion:\nThe generated answer is **CORRECT** across all evaluation methods."

The integral in question is:\n\n\\[\n\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x^2 \\, dx\n\\]\n\n### 1. Numerical Analysis\n- **Reasoning**: Numerical analysis involves approximating the integral using numerical methods. For improper integrals like this, we would typically evaluate the integral over a finite interval \\([-a, a]\\) and then take the limit as \\(a \\to \\infty\\). However, as \\(a\\) increases, the value of the integral \\(\\int_{-a}^{a} x^2 \\, dx = \\frac{2a^3}{3}\\) grows without bound. This suggests that the integral does not converge to a finite value.\n- **Conclusion**: CORRECT.\n\n### 2. Logical Reasoning\n- **Reasoning**: The function \\(x^2\\) is always non-negative and symmetric about the y-axis. As \\(x\\) approaches \\(\\pm\\infty\\), \\(x^2\\) grows without bound. Therefore, the area under the curve from \\(-\\infty\\) to \\(\\infty\\) is infinite. This logical reasoning aligns with the conclusion that the integral diverges.\n- **Conclusion**: CORRECT.\n\n### 3. Axiomatic Proof\n- **Reasoning**: In the context of real analysis, an integral \\(\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x) \\, dx\\) is said to converge if both \\(\\int_{-\\infty}^{0} f(x) \\, dx\\) and \\(\\int_{0}^{\\infty} f(x) \\, dx\\) converge. For \\(f(x) = x^2\\), both \\(\\int_{-\\infty}^{0} x^2 \\, dx\\) and \\(\\int_{0}^{\\infty} x^2 \\, dx\\) diverge to infinity. Therefore, by the axioms of integration, the integral \\(\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x^2 \\, dx\\) diverges.\n- **Conclusion**: CORRECT.\n\n### 4. Contradiction Proof\n- **Reasoning**: Assume, for contradiction, that the integral \\(\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x^2 \\, dx\\) converges to a finite value \\(L\\). Then, for any \\(\\epsilon > 0\\), there exists an \\(a > 0\\) such that \\(\\left| \\int_{-a}^{a} x^2 \\, dx - L \\right| < \\epsilon\\). However, as \\(a \\to \\infty\\), \\(\\int_{-a}^{a} x^2 \\, dx = \\frac{2a^3}{3}\\) grows without bound, which contradicts the assumption that the integral converges to a finite value \\(L\\).\n- **Conclusion**: CORRECT.\n\n### 5. Contrapositive Proof\n- **Reasoning**: The contrapositive of the statement \"If the integral converges, then the integrand must approach zero as \\(x \\to \\pm\\infty\\)\" is \"If the integrand does not approach zero as \\(x \\to \\pm\\infty\\), then the integral does not converge.\" For \\(f(x) = x^2\\), \\(f(x) \\to \\infty\\) as \\(x \\to \\pm\\infty\\), so the contrapositive implies that the integral does not converge.\n- **Conclusion**: CORRECT.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nAll five methods confirm that the integral \\(\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x^2 \\, dx\\) diverges.

The generated answer breaks 60 into prime factors \\( 2, 3, \\) and \\( 5 \\), which are all primes. The exponents are also correct, as \\( 2^2 \\) accounts for the two factors of 2 in 60.\n- **Conclusion**: CORRECT.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Axiomatic Proof**\n- **Reasoning**: The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic states that every integer greater than 1 has a unique prime factorization.

Then, there exists another prime factorization of 60 that is different from \\( 2^2 \\times 3 \\times 5 \\).

            "explanation": "Let's evaluate the correctness of the generated answer \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\) using the specified methods:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Numerical Analysis**\nTo determine the probability of rolling a sum of 7 with two dice, we first calculate the total number of possible outcomes when rolling two dice. Each die has 6 faces, so the total number of outcomes is \\( 6 \\times 6 = 36 \\).\n\nNext, we count the number of favorable outcomes that result in a sum of 7:\n- (1, 6)\n- (2, 5)\n- (3, 4)\n- (4, 3)\n- (5, 2)\n- (6, 1)\n\nThere are **6 favorable outcomes**. Therefore, the probability is:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\\text{Total number of outcomes}} = \\frac{6}{36} = \\frac{1}{6}.\n\\]\n\nThe generated answer \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\) matches this result.  \n**Conclusion: CORRECT**\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Logical Reasoning**\nThe sum of 7 is the most probable sum when rolling two dice because it has the highest number of combinations (6 combinations) compared to other sums. Since there are 36 total possible outcomes, the probability of rolling a 7 is \\( \\frac{6}{36} = \\frac{1}{6} \\). This aligns with the generated answer.  \n**Conclusion: CORRECT**\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Axiomatic Proof**\nProbability is defined as a measure of the likelihood of an event occurring, calculated as:\n\\[\nP(E) = \\frac{\\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\\text{Total number of possible outcomes}}.\n\\]\nHere, the event \\( E \\) is rolling a sum of 7. As shown in the numerical analysis, there are 6 favorable outcomes and 36 total outcomes. Thus:\n\\[\nP(E) = \\frac{6}{36} = \\frac{1}{6}.\n\\]\nThe generated answer \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\) is consistent with the axiomatic definition of probability.  \n**Conclusion: CORRECT**\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Contradiction Proof**\nAssume the probability of rolling a sum of 7 is not \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\). If the probability were greater than \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\), there would need to be more than 6 favorable outcomes, which is impossible because there are only 6 combinations that sum to 7. If the probability were less than \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\), there would need to be fewer than 6 favorable outcomes, which is also impossible because all 6 combinations are valid. Therefore, the probability must be exactly \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\).  \n**Conclusion: CORRECT**\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Contrapositive Proof**\nThe contrapositive of the statement \"If the probability is \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\), then the sum of 7 has 6 favorable outcomes\" is \"If the sum of 7 does not have 6 favorable outcomes, then the probability is not \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\).\" Since we know the sum of 7 has exactly 6 favorable outcomes, the contrapositive holds, and the probability must be \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\).  \n**Conclusion: CORRECT**\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\nAll five methods confirm that the generated answer \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\) is correct.  \n**Overall Conclusion: CORRECT**"

# MATH-marker GitHub Repository

## Overview

Welcome to the MATH-marker repository! This project is designed to improve the accuracy of mathematical assessments by leveraging multi-agent systems (MAS) and large language models (LLMs). Our innovative approach assesses student solutions using interpretable agents and sophisticated reasoning techniques.

## Features

- **Multi-Agent System**: Utilizes multiple agents to evaluate and grade mathematical solutions from various perspectives.
- **Chain-of-Thought Reasoning**: Applies advanced reasoning methods to enhance problem-solving capabilities.
- **Confidence Scoring**: Offers confidence levels for each evaluation to indicate the reliability of answers.
